                            Confidentiality of your Personal Information is of utmost importance to us. We will use all

                            information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to
                            protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee the integrity
                            and accuracy of any Personal Information which you transmit over the Internet, nor guarantee
                            that such Personal Information would not be intercepted, accessed, disclosed, altered or
                            destroyed by unauthorised third parties, due to factors beyond our control. You are
