                    For transaction security, Customers have the option to activate 2FA (Two Factor Factor
                    Authentication). 2FA is a feature whereby Customers provide identity verification 2 (two) times. For
                    example, if Customers implement log in to Bina Loka Account after inputting password, customers are
                    quired to input special code which is sent out through SMS or Google Authenticator. Customers are
                    able to activate 2FA SMS or 2FA Google Authenticator in Bina Loka. The use of 2FA security feature
                    provides greater security for account, data, asset and transaction history from breach from external
                    parties.
